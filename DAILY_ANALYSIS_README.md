## 📈 Daily Analysis Features

### 1. Cost Savings Analysis

The system automatically identifies cost saving opportunities:

- **High-Cost Animals**: Animals with costs 50% above average
- **Feeding Inefficiency**: Animals consuming less than 80% of provided food
- **Species Cost Comparison**: Cost analysis across different species
- **Seasonal Cost Patterns**: Monthly cost variations and trends

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "total_opportunities": 5,
  "total_potential_savings": 1250.50,
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "type": "high_cost_animal",
      "title": "High Cost Animal: Simba",
      "description": "Simba (Lion) has average daily cost of $85.20",
      "potential_savings": 12.78,
      "priority": "high",
      "recommendations": [
        "Review feeding schedule and quantities",
        "Optimize medical care protocols",
        "Consider alternative food sources"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Revenue Opportunity Analysis

Identifies revenue optimization strategies:

- **Low-Performing Animals**: Animals generating below-average revenue
- **Visitor Satisfaction**: Areas with low satisfaction scores
- **Peak Hour Optimization**: Off-peak hour utilization strategies
- **Weather-Based Opportunities**: Weather-revenue correlations

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "total_opportunities": 3,
  "total_potential_increase": 850.75,
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "type": "low_performing_animal",
      "title": "Low Revenue Animal: Nala",
      "description": "Nala generates only $12.50 daily",
      "potential_increase": 6.25,
      "priority": "high",
      "recommendations": [
        "Improve enclosure visibility",
        "Add educational signage",
        "Schedule feeding times during peak hours"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

FROM gold_animal_costs
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY animal_id, animal_name, species
HAVING AVG(total_daily_cost_usd) > (
    SELECT AVG(total_daily_cost_usd) * 1.5 
    FROM gold_animal_costs 
    WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
ORDER BY avg_daily_cost DESC
```
